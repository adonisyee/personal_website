I optimized wafer data analysis by writing python scripts to format data and generate calculations, analyses, reports, and data visualizations that helped increase yields from below 30% to over 88%. Cross-functionally partnering with engineers to assess pain-points, I helped save an average of 40 hrs/week in processing time per testing lot."
